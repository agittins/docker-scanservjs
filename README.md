# docker-scanservjs
Docker container to provide scanservjs.

This has been forked from toxic0berliner/docker-brother-mfc7320, and the printing and brother-specific aspects removed to make it as generic a sane scanner web front-end as possible.

Status

I just forked this now, it is not yet ready for use.
